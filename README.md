prms
====

This is a project report management system for internal use, achieved by struts-spring-hibernate, written by zhengjian and zhangrenbo.

You can use demo-prms.sql to rebuild the database.

As you can see, this project still has a lot of bug, because this is not a official use version.

It's free for you to download and modify as you want :-)
